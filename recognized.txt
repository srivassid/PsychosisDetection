I think what people don't really understand normal people who don't you know have experiences with these type of things is that me personally I had no idea what was going on it's not like I became angry at something or that something that something had really happened to me happened to me that was emotionally devastating it was just like I lost lost touch with reality I had been a normal kid happy-go-lucky you know my friends would poke fun at me because I was always smiling and always making jokes and I was the most upbeat and then in a matter of days like my mom said everything became sort of it felt like reality that I the reality that I had known was was distant and
I I couldn't communicate I was at that point hearing voices yes mainly in music I don't know how to explain it but the song the song lyrics would change and they would say hateful things racist things homophobic things they would tell me to harm people they would talk about harming people and I really didn't know how to vocalize it because I think any rational person would be like you're making this up this isn't this isn't true Andrew you know it's sort of like the boy who cried wolf so I figured I wouldn't cry because no one was going to come for me so did anybody ever come up with a diagnosis here at that point it was determined that Andrew had psychosis otherwise unspecified
and that was in June of 2008 and he was in the hospital for about 5 days that he came home and he was better after receiving some medication and he was seen by psychiatrist for several months and then he he went off his medication after about 6 months and about 3 months later without any other form of treatment no more visits to the psychiatrist no more talk therapy he had his second psychotic break So eventually Andrew did they tell you what what you had what what you were suffering from yeah I am my family and I met with a psychiatrist at UCSF and after after
and after one meeting probably 30 minutes meeting he decided that I had schizophrenia and I was I didn't feel very good about this diagnosis because I undisclosed psychosis was it sounded 10 times better than schizophrenia when I thought of schizophrenia I thought of teenagers you know beating up people and you know breaking laws and acting like Hooligans in a way you know out of control and that certainly wasn't me I was never physically aggressive sometimes frustrated but I never heard anyone in my in my experiences with psychosis but you said you said you said said said
but you said that when you were hearing voices especially in the song they're kind of urging you on to some sort of physical but I my parents brought me up well and I knew that this is something that's totally unacceptable and society and Society to hurt anyone and so I resisted these messages that I thought were being sent to me and I'm glad that I was able to persist and to avoid any physical education
